Question 1 - I added a sprite of Luffy that moves along the x axis. I added a sky blue back drop to make it look like the ocean or the sky and Luffy moves back and forth on a dock or pirate ship

Question 2 - Luffy stretches his arms upwards when the mouse is pressed as if he is using one of his gum-gum abilities

Question 3 - I added a falling piece of meat since that's luffy's favorite food and I set the random to (50,350) so it wouldn't go off the edge.

Question 4 - I made it so that the meat will fall from a random location when the user clicks the mouse. It will also disappear when it hits the ground.

Question 5 - I added a score board off to the side that keeps track of how many piece of meat you have eaten.
